@set 

The conversation focused on refactoring the Kelmah frontend codebase into a domain-driven design structure. We:
Created domain-specific modules in /modules/ (auth, common, contracts, dashboard, home, notifications, search)
Established consistent structure within modules (components/, contexts/, hooks/, pages/, services/, utils/)
Migrated key files to appropriate modules (Home.jsx, AuthContext.jsx, ContractService.js, etc.)
Created missing common components (LoadingScreen.jsx, GestureControl.jsx, WorkAnimation.jsx, Toast.jsx)
Developed support scripts (cleanup.ps1, update-imports.ps1, final-cleanup.ps1)
Added documentation (guides and summaries of the refactoring)
The refactoring improved organization by grouping related functionality, enhanced maintainability, reduced duplication, and provided consistent structure. Recommended next steps included running import updates, completing component migration, testing, and code review.

The above is what I was doing.

Check well because I noticed you are not working on the right dir.

Please scan through my codebase to check for the existance of needed file in a particular dir. Note that old files exist and we are trying to restructure.

1. Defining the Scheduling System
A scheduling system is a natural extension of the messaging and contract features, allowing users to formalize meeting times for interviews or project discussions.
Key Features:
A full-page calendar view to display all scheduled events.
The ability to create, view, and modify events.
Events will be linked to specific jobs or contracts where applicable.
Integration with the notification system to remind users of upcoming events.
Implementation Plan:
Explore the existing calendar module to see if a foundation is already in place.
Create a calendarService.js and CalendarContext.jsx to manage event data and state, following our established pattern.
Implement a CalendarPage.jsx that will use a library like react-big-calendar for a rich, interactive UI.
Create an EventDialog.jsx component to handle the creation and editing of events.
Integrate scheduling actions into other parts of the application, such as adding a "Schedule Meeting" button within the ChatWindow or on the ContractDetailsPage.
2. Defining Premium Features
Premium features will be offered through a subscription model to provide enhanced value to power users (both workers and hirers).
Proposed Features:
For Workers:
Profile Boost: Get priority placement in search results.
Advanced Analytics: See who has viewed your profile and how you rank in searches.
Read Receipts: See when hirers have read your messages.
For Hirers:
Featured Job Postings: Make job listings more prominent.
Access to Top Talent: Unlock the ability to search for and contact a pool of "Kelmah Verified" top-tier workers.
Advanced Search Filters: Use more specific criteria to find the perfect worker.
Implementation Plan:
Create a SubscriptionContext.jsx that tracks the current user's subscription status (e.g., free, pro, business).
Build a SubscriptionPage.jsx where users can view, compare, and upgrade to different subscription tiers.
Gate features throughout the application: I will modify existing components to check the user's subscription status from the context. Premium features will be visible but disabled for free users, with a prompt to upgrade.
