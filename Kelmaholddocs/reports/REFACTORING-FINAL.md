# Project Kelmah Refactoring - Final Summary

## What We Did

### 1. Implemented Domain-Driven Structure
We reorganized the entire codebase from a technical-layer approach to a domain-driven structure:
- Created domain modules in `kelmah-frontend/src/modules/`
- Each module (auth, worker, hirer, jobs, etc.) contains its own components, services, and hooks
- Grouped related functionality together for better maintainability

### 2. Relocated Files
- Moved Redux slices from `store/slices/` to their respective domain module service directories
- Relocated API services to their domain-specific locations
- Restructured components to be within their respective domain modules
- Ensured shared services like axios are in common locations

### 3. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated import paths throughout the codebase to reflect the new structure
- Standardized import patterns for services, components, and contexts
- Created reusable scripts to handle import path updates

### 4. Added Common Utilities
- Created shared axios instance in `common/services`
- Set up apiUtils for API interactions
- Ensured proper contexts for features like notifications
- Added necessary component files and utilities

## Scripts Created

The following scripts were developed to automate the refactoring process:
- `master-refactoring-fix.ps1` - Complete solution that applies all fixes
- `fix-module-imports.ps1` - Updates import paths
- `fix-remaining-imports.ps1` - Targets specific problematic imports
- `fix-specific-imports.ps1` - Even more targeted import fixes
- `create-notification-context.ps1` - Ensures notification context exists
- `setup-api-utils.ps1` - Creates API utilities
- And others for specific aspects of the refactoring

## Next Steps

1. Test the application to ensure all imports are working correctly
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Fix any runtime issues that may arise
4. Consider implementing import aliases for improved maintainability (e.g., `@modules/auth`)

## Conclusion

The refactoring to a domain-driven architecture sets a solid foundation for future development. The codebase is now organized logically by business domains, making it more maintainable and easier to extend.

The scripts created during this process can be reused if additional import issues arise or if new modules need to be added to the structure.
