# Project-Kelmah Refactoring Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Module Structure Setup
- Created domain-driven module structure according to the specified organization
- Moved related files into their respective module directories

### Store Slices Migration
- Moved store slices to their respective domain modules:
  - `authSlice.js` → `modules/auth/services/`
  - `jobSlice.js` → `modules/jobs/services/`
  - `reviewsSlice.js` → `modules/reviews/services/`
  - `calendarSlice.js` → `modules/calendar/services/`
  - `dashboardSlice.js` → `modules/dashboard/services/`
  - `contractSlice.js` → `modules/contracts/services/`
  - `appSlice.js` → `modules/common/services/`
  - `workerSlice.js` → `modules/worker/services/`
  - `hirerSlice.js` → `modules/hirer/services/`
  - `notificationSlice.js` → `modules/notifications/services/`

### Service Migration
- Moved service files to their respective domain modules:
  - API services moved to domain modules
  - Created/moved `axios.js` to `modules/common/services/`
  - Moved `messagingService.js` to `modules/messaging/services/`
  - Moved `reviewService.js` to `modules/reviews/services/`

### Component Organization
- Reorganized job components:
  - Moved `JobCard` to `modules/jobs/components/listing/`
  - Moved `JobApplication` to `modules/jobs/components/job-application/`
- Created/ensured SEO component exists at `modules/common/components/common/SEO.jsx`
- Verified AuthContext exists at `modules/auth/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

### Import Path Updates
- Updated import paths in slice files to reference their new locations
- Updated import paths in component files to reference the new module structure
- Created scripts to automate path corrections

## Remaining Issues

### Potential Import Issues
The following import paths still need to be verified and potentially fixed:
1. Components importing from `src/components/` when they should import from module directories
2. References to old API paths that need to be updated
3. References to common components that may have moved

### Next Steps
1. Test the application to identify any remaining import issues
2. Fix any runtime errors that occur from the refactoring
3. Update components to use the correct paths consistently
4. Consider creating an import alias system to make imports more maintainable

## Important Recommendations
- Consider using an import alias system (like `@modules/auth` instead of relative paths)
- Update any CI/CD pipelines to reflect the new project structure
- Update documentation to reflect the new module structure
- Create a standard for future development to maintain the domain-driven architecture
