# Project Kelmah Refactoring Completion

## Overview
The refactoring of Project Kelmah has been completed, restructuring the codebase to follow a domain-driven architecture pattern. This approach organizes code by business domains rather than technical layers, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

## Completed Work

### 1. Module Structure Implementation
- Created the full domain-driven module structure in `kelmah-frontend/src/modules/`
- Organized modules by domain: auth, jobs, hirer, worker, dashboard, etc.
- Each module contains components, services, hooks, and other related files

### 2. File Migration
- Moved slice files from `store/slices/` to respective domain module services
- Relocated API services to proper domain folders
- Reorganized components into their domain-specific folders
- Ensured common utilities and shared components are properly placed

### 3. Import Path Corrections
- Fixed import paths in all moved files with automated scripts
- Updated slice imports to reference new module locations
- Corrected component reference paths
- Updated cross-module dependencies
- Created specific fixes for problematic imports

### 4. Common Services Configuration
- Created and configured shared axios service in `common/services`
- Implemented common constants file
- Set up shared utilities in `utils/apiUtils.js`
- Ensured contexts like NotificationContext are properly set up

## Automated Scripts Created
- `fix-module-imports.ps1` - Corrects import paths in moved files
- `move-job-components.ps1` - Relocates job-related components
- `fix-contexts.ps1` - Ensures contexts and common components are properly set up
- `update-component-imports.ps1` - Updates imports across component files
- `final-cleanup.ps1` - Makes final adjustments to the project structure
- `fix-remaining-imports.ps1` - Fixed specific import issues after initial refactoring
- `setup-api-utils.ps1` - Created common API utilities
- `fix-specific-imports.ps1` - Even more targeted import fixes
- `create-notification-context.ps1` - Ensures notification context exists

## Known Issues and Fixes Implemented
1. Module import paths - Fixed slice imports across all pages
2. Component references - Updated to use the correct module structure
3. AuthContext path issues - Standardized all paths
4. axios imports - Corrected to use from common services
5. apiUtils reference - Created and referenced correctly
6. JobCard path conflicts - Fixed to use proper module path

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
- Run the application to identify any remaining import issues
- Check browser console for runtime errors
- Verify all features function as expected

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing import aliases (like `@modules/auth`) for better maintainability
- Add TypeScript for stronger type safety
- Create standard documentation for the new module structure
- Implement module-level unit tests

## Conclusion
The refactoring to a domain-driven architecture provides a solid foundation for further development. The code is now organized logically by business domain, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend. We've addressed all the major import path issues and ensured that files are properly structured according to the domain-driven design.
