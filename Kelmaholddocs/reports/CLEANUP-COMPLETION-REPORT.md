## 🚀 **HOW TO START THE SYSTEM**

### **Backend (All Services)**
```bash
cd kelmah-backend
npm start
# OR for development
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- 🌐 API Gateway (localhost:3000) - **MAIN ENTRY POINT**
- 🔐 Auth Service (localhost:3001)  
- 👥 User Service (localhost:3002)
- 💼 Job Service (localhost:3003)
- 💳 Payment Service (localhost:3004)  
- 💬 Messaging Service (localhost:3005)

### **Frontend**
```bash
cd kelmah-frontend  
npm run dev
# Runs on localhost:5173
```

### **Individual Services (if needed)**
```bash
npm run start:gateway  # API Gateway only
npm run start:auth     # Auth Service only
npm run start:user     # User Service only
# etc.
```
