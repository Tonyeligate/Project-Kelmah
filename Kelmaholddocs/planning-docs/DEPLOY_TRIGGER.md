# Deployment Trigger
# Last updated: August 16, 2025 - Manual Vercel deployment required
# This file triggers Vercel deployments when changes are pushed to main branch

## Issue: 
Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub is not working properly. The kelmah-frontend project exists but Git integration may be misconfigured.

## Solutions:
1. **Manual deploy**: Run `./deploy.sh` from repo root
2. **Fix Git integration**: In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Git → reconnect repository
3. **Check project settings**: Ensure "Production Branch" is set to `main`

## Current Status:
- Local build: ✅ Working (confirmed via npm run build)
- Vercel config: ✅ @vercel/static-build configured correctly
- GitHub pushes: ✅ All commits on origin/main
- Auto-deploy: ❌ Not triggering from GitHub webhooks
