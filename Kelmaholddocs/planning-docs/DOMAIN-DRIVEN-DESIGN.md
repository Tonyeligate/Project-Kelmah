# Domain-Driven Design in Project Kelmah

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding the business domain and using that understanding to guide the architecture and design of the system. In our React application, this means organizing code around business domains rather than technical layers.

## Benefits of Our DDD Approach

### 1. Code Organization by Business Functionality
- **Before**: Components grouped by type (components, services, pages)  
- **After**: Components grouped by domain (auth, jobs, worker, hirer)

This makes it easier to find and modify related code, as everything needed for a specific domain feature is in a single directory.

### 2. Improved Maintainability
- New developers can understand the business domains more clearly
- Changes to a specific domain are isolated to that domain's directory
- Reusable components and services are explicitly separated into common modules

### 3. Better Scalability
- New features can be added to relevant domains without impacting others
- The application can grow in a controlled, organized manner
- Domain boundaries help enforce separation of concerns

### 4. Enhanced Team Collaboration
- Teams can work on different domains simultaneously with minimal conflicts
- Domain experts can focus on specific business areas
- Ownership of domains can be assigned to specific team members

## Best Practices for Our DDD Implementation

### Keep Domain Logic Self-Contained
Each domain module should contain all its required logic, with minimal dependencies on other domains. Cross-domain dependencies should be explicit and carefully managed.

### Use Consistent Naming
Follow consistent naming patterns across domain modules to make the codebase more predictable:
- `services` for business logic and API calls
- `components` for UI components
- `hooks` for custom React hooks

### Maintain Clear Domain Boundaries
Avoid creating circular dependencies between domains. Use shared/common modules for truly shared functionality.

### Document Cross-Domain Interactions
When domains need to interact, document the interfaces and dependencies clearly.

## Import Rules for Our New Structure

1. **Same Domain**: Use relative imports
   ```javascript
   import { SomeComponent } from '../components/SomeComponent';
   ```

2. **Cross-Domain**: Use absolute paths from src
   ```javascript
   import { AuthContext } from '../../auth/contexts/AuthContext';
   ```

3. **Common Utilities**: Import from common modules
   ```javascript
   import axiosInstance from '../../common/services/axios';
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Consider Path Aliases**: Implement path aliases to make imports cleaner
   ```javascript
   // Before
   import { AuthContext } from '../../../auth/contexts/AuthContext';
   
   // After (with aliases)
   import { AuthContext } from '@modules/auth/contexts/AuthContext';
   ```

2. **Domain Events**: Implement a proper domain event system for cross-domain communication

3. **API Layer Refinement**: Continue refining the API layer to be more domain-focused

4. **Automated Testing**: Organize tests to mirror the domain structure
