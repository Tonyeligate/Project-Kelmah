## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Worker Dashboard
2. Test each component individually following the checklist
3. Verify that each interaction provides appropriate visual feedback
4. Confirm that the application state updates correctly after each interaction
5. Check that all animations are smooth and provide a polished user experience

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If any component does not respond to interaction, check the browser console for errors
- If loading states persist indefinitely, refresh the page and try again
- If notifications don't appear, verify that the Snackbar component is properly positioned and visible
- If dialogs appear but don't contain expected content, check that the data is being passed correctly

## Future Enhancements

- Add real API integration instead of simulated responses
- Implement form validation for inputs in dialogs
- Add more detailed error handling and recovery options
- Consider adding undo/redo functionality for important actions
