# QUICK FIX: Render Deployment Issue - Action Checklist

## üö® URGENT PROBLEM
Render is deploying from **spec-kit submodule commit `05eceec`** instead of **main repo commit `17e9aeda`**

Result: Build fails, API Gateway fix NOT deployed

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Check Which Service Failed (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Look for service with **"Build failed üòû"** status
3. Note the service name (likely API Gateway, User Service, or Job Service)

### Step 2: Fix Repository Configuration (5 minutes)
For the failed service:

1. Click on the service name
2. Go to **Settings** (left sidebar)
3. Scroll to **Repository** section
4. **VERIFY THESE**:
   - Repository: `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah` ‚úÖ
   - Branch: `main` ‚úÖ
   - Must NOT say `/spec-kit` anywhere ‚ùå
5. Scroll to **Build & Deploy** section
6. **CHECK Root Directory**:
   - API Gateway: `kelmah-backend/api-gateway` ‚úÖ
   - User Service: `kelmah-backend/services/user-service` ‚úÖ
   - Job Service: `kelmah-backend/services/job-service` ‚úÖ
   - Must NOT say `spec-kit` ‚ùå

### Step 3: Manual Redeploy (3 minutes)
1. Still in the service page, click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
2. Select **Branch**: `main`
3. Select **Commit**: Look for `17e9aeda` or "Emergency fixes for job browsing"
4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. Watch the build logs - should see:
   ```
   ==> Checking out commit 17e9aeda...  ‚úÖ (not 05eceec ‚ùå)
   ==> Installing dependencies from package.json  ‚úÖ
   ==> Build successful  ‚úÖ
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Other Services (10 minutes)
Repeat Step 2 for ALL these services to prevent future issues:
- [ ] API Gateway
- [ ] Auth Service
- [ ] User Service  
- [ ] Job Service
- [ ] Messaging Service
- [ ] Payment Service
- [ ] Review Service

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚ùå WRONG Configuration (Causes Build Failure)
```
Repository: Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah/spec-kit  ‚Üê WRONG
Root Directory: spec-kit  ‚Üê WRONG
Checking out: 05eceec  ‚Üê WRONG (spec-kit commit)
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Configuration
```
Repository: Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah  ‚Üê CORRECT
Root Directory: kelmah-backend/api-gateway  ‚Üê CORRECT (example)
Checking out: 17e9aeda  ‚Üê CORRECT (main repo commit)
```

---

## üìä After Fix: What Should Happen

1. **Build Logs Should Show**:
   ```
   ==> Cloning from https://github.com/Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah
   ==> Checking out commit 17e9aeda in branch main
   ==> Installing from kelmah-backend/api-gateway/package.json
   ==> Build succeeded
   ==> Deploy live
   ```

2. **Test Job Browsing**:
   ```bash
   curl https://kelmah-api-gateway-si57.onrender.com/api/jobs?status=open&limit=5
   ```
   - Should return: **200 OK** with job data
   - Previously: **404 Not Found**

3. **Check Service Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://kelmah-api-gateway-si57.onrender.com/health
   ```
   - Should return: **200 OK**

---

## üÜò If Build Still Fails

### Common Issues:

**1. Still checking out `05eceec`**
- Problem: Render cached the wrong repository
- Fix: Settings ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Click "Disconnect" ‚Üí Reconnect to `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah`

**2. Can't find package.json**
- Problem: Root directory is wrong
- Fix: Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Root Directory = `kelmah-backend/[service-path]`

**3. Build succeeds but 404 persists**
- Problem: Wrong service was fixed (need to fix API Gateway specifically)
- Fix: Ensure you're deploying **API Gateway** service, not others

**4. Multiple services showing error**
- Problem: All services might be misconfigured
- Fix: Go through each service and verify repository settings

## üìù Environment Variables Reminder

While you're in Render dashboard, remember to set **User Service** environment variables:

1. Go to **User Service** ‚Üí **Environment**
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://TonyGate:0553366244Aj@kelmah-messaging.xyqcurn.mongodb.net/kelmah_platform?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Kelmah-messaging
   
   JWT_SECRET=Deladem_Tony
   
   INTERNAL_API_KEY=kelmah-internal-key-2024
   
   NODE_ENV=production
   
   FRONTEND_URL=https://project-kelmah.vercel.app
   ```
3. Save (triggers redeploy)

This fixes the **worker search 500 error** (second production issue).

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After completing all steps:

- [ ] Failed service identified in Render dashboard
- [ ] Repository configuration verified (points to main repo)
- [ ] Root directory verified (correct path)
- [ ] Manual deploy triggered with commit `17e9aeda`
- [ ] Build logs show correct commit being checked out
- [ ] Build succeeds (no package.json error)
- [ ] Service shows "Live" status
- [ ] Job browsing endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] User Service environment variables set (MONGODB_URI)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- Identify issue: **2 minutes**
- Fix one service: **5 minutes**
- Verify all services: **10 minutes**
- Set environment variables: **5 minutes**
- Test both fixes: **3 minutes**

**Total: ~25 minutes** to fully resolve both production issues
