- **Affected Services**: Payment, Messaging, Review services
- **Standard Pattern**: Job Service correctly uses shared pattern
- **Impact**: Harder maintenance, inconsistent connection handling

#### 2. Missing Configuration Infrastructure (67% Missing)
- **Issue**: 4/6 services lack `config/` directories
- **Affected Services**: Payment, Messaging, Review, User services
- **Standard Pattern**: Auth and Job services have proper config structure
- **Impact**: Configuration scattered in server.js files

#### 3. Server.js Architecture Violations (33% Non-Compliant)
- **Issue**: 2/6 services have business logic in server.js
- **Affected Services**: Auth (admin routes), User (worker routes + stub data)
- **Standard Pattern**: Job, Payment, Messaging, Review follow clean MVC
- **Impact**: Violates single responsibility, harder testing

#### 4. Rate Limiting Inconsistency (33% Non-Standard)
- **Issue**: 2/6 services use local rate limiters instead of shared
- **Affected Services**: Review, Messaging services
- **Standard Pattern**: Most services attempt shared rate limiter
- **Impact**: Inconsistent rate limiting behavior

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES BY SERVICE

### Auth Service - HIGH PRIORITY (5 Issues)
1. **Monolithic Server.js**: 517-line server with inline admin routes
2. **Duplicate Admin Routes**: Same functionality on `/api/admin/` and `/api/auth/admin/`
3. **Mixed JWT Systems**: Shared + local JWT utilities
4. **Database Logic in Server**: Connection handling in server.js
5. **Scattered Environment Validation**: Config logic fragmented

### User Service - MEDIUM PRIORITY (4 Issues)
1. **Inline Worker Routes**: Direct route handlers in server.js
2. **Stub Appointments Data**: Hardcoded fake data endpoint
3. **Mixed Route Mounting**: Inconsistent route mounting patterns
4. **Database Logic in Server**: Connection handling in server.js

### Job Service - LOW PRIORITY (3 Issues)
1. **Database Connection in Startup**: DB retry logic in server.js
2. **Disabled Environment Validation**: Shared validation commented out
3. **Complex Rate Limiting**: Business logic in middleware

### Payment Service - MEDIUM PRIORITY (4 Issues)
1. **Inconsistent Database Pattern**: Direct mongoose.connect()
2. **Missing Config Directory**: No config/db.js file
3. **Business Logic in Startup**: Reconciliation cron in server.js
4. **Direct Controller Imports**: Controllers imported in server.js

### Messaging Service - MEDIUM PRIORITY (5 Issues)
1. **Database Connection Pattern**: Custom connectDB implementation
2. **Missing Config Infrastructure**: No config directory
3. **Inline Route Handler**: Business logic in routes file
4. **Socket Operations in Server**: WebSocket logic mixed with HTTP
5. **Undefined Middleware**: authMiddleware referenced but not imported

### Review Service - LOW PRIORITY (4 Issues)
1. **Database Connection Pattern**: Direct mongoose.connect()
2. **Missing Config Infrastructure**: No config directory
3. **Rate Limiting Inconsistency**: Local instead of shared limiter
4. **Direct Route Mounting**: All routes in server.js

1. **Auth Service**: Extract admin controller, remove duplicate routes
2. **User Service**: Remove inline routes, fix stub data endpoints
3. **Database Standardization**: Implement shared connectDB pattern across all services

### Phase 2: Configuration Infrastructure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Create Missing Configs**: Add config/db.js to Payment, Messaging, Review, User services
2. **Environment Consolidation**: Centralize environment validation
3. **Configuration Patterns**: Standardize config file structure

### Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Rate Limiting**: Standardize shared rate limiter usage
