# Kelmah Platform - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Architecture Overview

Kelmah is a **freelance marketplace** with a **microservices backend** and **modular React frontend**. The system uses an **API Gateway pattern** with service-specific microservices, all routing through a central gateway for the frontend.

### Backend: Microservices Architecture
- **API Gateway** (`kelmah-backend/api-gateway/`) - Central routing hub on port 3000
- **Services** (`kelmah-backend/services/`): auth, user, job, payment, messaging, review
- **Tech Stack**: Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Socket.IO, JWT auth, Winston logging
- **Key Pattern**: Each service has `server.js`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`

### Frontend: Domain-Driven Modules
- **Modular Structure** (`kelmah-frontend/src/modules/`): auth, jobs, dashboard, worker, hirer, etc.
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI, React Query, Socket.IO client
- **Key Pattern**: Each module has `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, `contexts/`, `hooks/`

## Critical Development Workflows

### Backend Development
```bash
# Start all services in development
npm run dev  # from kelmah-backend/

# Start individual services
npm run start:gateway  # API Gateway on :3000
npm run start:auth     # Auth service on :5001
npm run start:messaging # Messaging service on :5004 (Socket.IO)

# Testing and debugging
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
node test-*.js        # Run specific debug scripts
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Server restart/shutdown operations must be performed only by the project owner.**

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Development server (from kelmah-frontend/)
npm run dev  # Vite dev server on :3000

# Build for production
npm run build  # Creates build/ directory
```

### Service Communication
- **Frontend → API Gateway**: All API calls go through `/api/*` routes
- **Gateway → Services**: Proxy routing with service registry pattern
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO client connects to messaging service via gateway

## Key Configuration Patterns

### Environment Management
- **Frontend**: `src/config/environment.js` - Centralized config with service URL detection
- **Backend**: Each service has its own `.env` with shared patterns
- **Production**: Uses ngrok tunneling for external API access (see `vercel.json` rewrites)

### Service Registry (API Gateway)
```javascript
// From api-gateway/server.js
const SERVICES = {
  auth: process.env.AUTH_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:5001',
  user: process.env.USER_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:5002'
  // ... other services
};
```

### Frontend API Configuration
```javascript
// Centralized axios in src/modules/common/services/axios.js
// Auto-detects environment and routes via gateway in production
const baseURL = await getApiBaseUrl(); // '/api' in production, service URLs in dev
```

## Domain-Specific Patterns

### Frontend Module Structure
```
src/modules/[domain]/
├── components/        # Domain-specific React components
│   └── common/       # Shared within module
├── pages/            # Route-level components
├── services/         # API calls, Redux slices
├── contexts/         # React Context providers
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
└── utils/            # Domain utilities
```

### Backend Service Structure  
```
services/[service-name]/
├── server.js         # Express app entry point
├── routes/           # Route definitions
├── controllers/      # Request handlers  
├── models/           # Mongoose schemas
├── services/         # Business logic
├── middleware/       # Service-specific middleware
└── utils/           # Utilities, logging, validation
```

### Import Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: Use `@/modules/[domain]/...` for absolute imports
- **Module imports**: `import { Component } from '@/modules/common/components/Component'`
- **Backend**: Relative imports within services, shared utilities in `../../shared/`

## State Management Patterns

### Redux Store Structure (Frontend)
- **Modular slices**: Each domain has its own slice in `modules/[domain]/services/`
- **Global store**: `src/store/index.js` combines all domain slices
- **Async actions**: Use Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` pattern

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: Frontend → Gateway `/api/auth/login` → Auth Service
2. **JWT Storage**: Uses `secureStorage` utility (localStorage/sessionStorage)
3. **Axios Interceptors**: Auto-attach tokens, handle refresh logic
4. **Socket.IO Auth**: Token passed via connection auth

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Production Setup
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel with API rewrites to backend
- **Backend**: Services run on containers/EC2 with internal load balancing
- **Database**: MongoDB clusters per service
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO with Redis adapter for scaling

### Key Files for Deployment
- `kelmah-frontend/vercel.json` - Frontend deployment config with API rewrites
- `kelmah-backend/api-gateway/server.js` - Service registry and routing
- `.env` files - Service-specific environment variables

### Development Debugging
- **Health Checks**: All services expose `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live` endpoints
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured JSON output
- **Service Status**: Use `src/utils/serviceHealthCheck.js` for frontend service monitoring
- **Testing**: Jest-based testing with coverage thresholds (90% critical, 70% non-critical)
- **Debug Scripts**: Use dedicated scripts for service testing (`test-*.js` files in root)

## Common Gotchas

1. **Import Paths**: After refactoring, use new modular paths (`@/modules/[domain]/...`)
2. **Service URLs**: Frontend detects environment and routes through gateway in production
3. **CORS**: API Gateway handles CORS for all services
4. **Socket.IO**: Connects through gateway proxy, not directly to messaging service
5. **Rate Limiting**: Configured at API Gateway level, affects all services

## Error Investigation & Fix Protocol

### Systematic Error Investigation Process
1. **Error Analysis**: List ALL files involved in test/error reports - no guesswork, read all files completely
2. **Root Cause Location**: Read listed files thoroughly to locate exact error lines in code
3. **Cross-Reference Scanning**: Scan related files to confirm actual error cause
4. **Flow Validation**: Confirm complete file process flow and logic before proposing fixes
5. **Solution Verification**: Validate fix accuracy by scanning ALL files in the process flow

### Critical Investigation Rules
- **Always read files**: For accuracy, read all files related to the subject matter
- **No assumptions**: Base solutions on actual code analysis, not assumptions
- **Complete flow understanding**: Trace entire process flow before implementing fixes

## User Experience & Accessibility Guidelines

### Target User Considerations
- **Primary Users**: Vocational workers (carpenters, masons, plumbers, electricians, etc.)
- **Accessibility**: Many users may be illiterate or have limited formal education
- **Design Principle**: Make interfaces intuitive, simple, and easy to use

### Professional UI/UX Standards
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across devices
- **Functional Components**: Every clickable element must be properly functional
- **Professional Appearance**: Maintain clean, professional visual design
- **Navigation Flow**: Verify smooth navigation between pages and sections

### Development Quality Assurance
- **Component Functionality**: Test all interactive elements work as intended
- **Responsive Testing**: Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes
- **Deep Scanning**: Thoroughly scan all files involved in each area of the codebase
- **Flow Validation**: Check navigation and user flow patterns work correctly

## Frontend Enhancement Protocol

### Module Protection
- **Preserve Structure**: Do NOT modify anything in `@/modules` directory
- **Extension Focus**: Improve other frontend areas that need enhancement

### Continuous Improvement Process
1. **Professional Standards**: Make pages look professional and ensure functionality
2. **Component Verification**: Scan and verify all page components work correctly
3. **Knowledge-Based Decisions**: Reference project documentation for informed decisions
4. **Visual Enhancement**: Improve visual display of pages and components
5. **Navigation Testing**: Check flow between different pages works correctly

### File Management Protocol
- **Deep Search Required**: Before deleting files, perform thorough search to confirm they're unused
- **Documentation Reference**: Use project knowledge from documentation for decision-making
- **Professional Standards**: Apply professional judgment based on project purpose
