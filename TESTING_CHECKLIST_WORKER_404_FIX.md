# Testing Checklist: Worker Endpoint 404 Fix

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Commits**: 321477fd (debug logging), 2e007566 (fix), 01c8c446 (docs)  
**Services Affected**: API Gateway, User Service

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause Identified
Conflicting route definitions causing routing interference:
- ❌ **Problem**: Direct worker routes (`/workers`, `/workers/search`) defined at server.js level
- ❌ **Problem**: Proper worker routes defined in `user.routes.js` mounted at `/api/users`
- ❌ **Problem**: Direct routes were redundant and potentially shadowing router routes

### Solution Applied
- ✅ Removed conflicting direct routes from `user-service/server.js`
- ✅ All worker routes now handled by `userRoutes` router as designed
- ✅ Clean route resolution: Gateway → `/api/users` mount → router routes

## ✅ Test Cases

### Test 1: Recent Jobs Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/workers/jobs/recent?limit=6`  
**Expected Result**: 
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: Array of recent job postings
- Structure: `{ success: true, data: [...], pagination: {...} }`

**How to Test**:
1. Open browser dashboard
2. Check "Recent Jobs" section on worker profile
3. Verify jobs display correctly
4. Check browser console for any errors

**Debug Logs to Check**:
```
🔍 [API Gateway] /api/users route hit: { method: 'GET', originalUrl: '/api/users/workers/jobs/recent?limit=6', ... }
✅ [API Gateway] Public worker route - skipping auth: /workers/jobs/recent
📤 [API Gateway] Proxying to user service: { path: '/api/users/workers/jobs/recent?limit=6', ... }
🌐 [USER-SERVICE] Incoming request: { originalUrl: '/api/users/workers/jobs/recent', ... }
✅ [USER-ROUTES] /workers/jobs/recent route hit: { query: { limit: '6' }, ... }
📥 [API Gateway] Response from user service: { statusCode: 200, ... }
```

```

---

### Test 3: Profile Completeness Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/workers/{workerId}/completeness`  
**Expected Result**:
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: Profile completion percentage and missing fields

**How to Test**:
1. View worker profile details
2. Check profile completion indicator
3. Verify percentage calculates correctly
4. Check browser console for errors

**Debug Logs to Check**:
```
🔍 [API Gateway] /api/users route hit: { originalUrl: '/api/users/workers/[id]/completeness', ... }
✅ [API Gateway] Public worker route - skipping auth: /workers/[id]/completeness
📤 [API Gateway] Proxying to user service: { path: '/api/users/workers/[id]/completeness', ... }
🌐 [USER-SERVICE] Incoming request: { originalUrl: '/api/users/workers/[id]/completeness', ... }
✅ [USER-ROUTES] /workers/:id/completeness route hit: { workerId: '[id]', ... }
📥 [API Gateway] Response from user service: { statusCode: 200, ... }
```

### Test 4: Worker Listing (Bonus)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/workers?page=1&limit=20`  
**Expected Result**:
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: Paginated list of workers
- Structure: `{ success: true, data: [...], pagination: {...} }`

**How to Test**:
1. Navigate to workers search/browse page
2. Verify worker cards display
3. Test pagination controls
4. Check browser console for errors

---

### Test 5: Worker Search (Bonus)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/workers/search?query=carpenter&location=Accra`  
**Expected Result**:
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: Filtered workers matching search criteria
- Structure: `{ success: true, data: [...], total: X }`

**How to Test**:
1. Use worker search form
2. Enter search criteria (skills, location)
3. Verify filtered results display
4. Check browser console for errors

## 🔍 How to Access Debug Logs

### Option 1: Render Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Select `kelmah-api-gateway-5loa` service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for emoji-prefixed logs (🔍, ✅, 📤, 📥)
5. Repeat for `kelmah-user-service-47ot`

### Option 2: Render API (if needed)
```powershell
# Get Gateway logs
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer rnd_Gur2yPUwz2RORCOwP7vbjYZvzZ5s" }
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3hjv0buibrs73avs5rg/logs" -Headers $headers

# Get User Service logs  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3hk4fe3jp1c73fk1hjg/logs" -Headers $headers
```

## ❌ If Tests Still Fail

### Scenario A: Still Getting 404
**Possible Causes**:
1. Render auto-deploy hasn't completed yet (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. Browser cache showing old errors (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Different routing issue not caught by the fix

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check Render logs for the debug messages
2. Verify commit 2e007566 is deployed (check Render deployment history)
3. Test endpoints directly with curl/Postman
4. Share debug logs with me for further analysis

### Scenario B: Getting Different Error (500, 503, etc.)
**What to Check**:
1. Error message in browser console
2. Status code and response body
3. Debug logs showing where request fails
4. MongoDB connection status (if 500 error)

**Next Actions**:
- Share error details
- Check if MongoDB timeout (cold start issue)
- Investigate specific service causing error

### Scenario C: No Debug Logs Appearing
**Possible Causes**:
1. Services didn't redeploy with new code
2. Logs not being output to Render console
3. Different endpoint being called

**Debug Steps**:
1. Verify latest commit hash in Render deployment
2. Check service restart times
3. Manually trigger redeploy if needed

## 📊 Success Criteria

All tests pass when:
- ✅ All three worker endpoints return `200 OK`
- ✅ Data structure matches expected format
- ✅ No 404 errors in browser console
- ✅ Worker profiles load completely
- ✅ Debug logs show complete request flow

---

## 🎯 Post-Testing Actions

### If All Tests Pass:
1. ✅ Remove debug logging (clean up verbose console.log statements)
2. ✅ Update production error report to mark as VERIFIED FIXED
3. ✅ Move on to remaining issues (MongoDB timeouts, WebSocket)

### If Tests Partially Pass:
1. 🔄 Document which endpoints work and which don't
2. 🔄 Analyze debug logs for working vs failing endpoints
3. 🔄 Identify any remaining routing or configuration issues

### If Tests Fail:
1. ❌ Capture full error details (status, message, stack trace)
2. ❌ Share debug logs showing request flow
3. ❌ Investigate alternative solutions

## 📝 Notes

- **Deployment Time**: Render auto-deploy typically takes 2-3 minutes
- **Cache Issues**: Always do hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) when testing
- **Cold Starts**: First request after deployment may be slow (15-30 seconds)
- **MongoDB Timeouts**: Separate issue, not related to 404 fix
- **Debug Logs**: Will be removed after verification for production cleanliness

---

**Testing Status**: ⏳ Awaiting user testing after Render deployment  
**Next Update**: After test results are shared
