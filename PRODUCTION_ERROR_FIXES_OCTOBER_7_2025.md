# Kelmah Production Error Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Executive Summary
This document tracks all production errors encountered during the October 7, 2025 debugging session and their resolution status.

---

## ✅ SUCCESSFULLY FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Notifications Endpoint (401 → 404 → 200 OK) ✅
**Original Error**: 401 "No token provided" → 404 Not Found  
**Root Causes**:
1. Missing `axios` import in API Gateway server.js causing ReferenceError
2. Incorrect target URL construction in manual proxy (missing `/api/notifications` prefix)

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Commit 9749e219**: Added `const axios = require('axios');` to API Gateway imports
- **Commit 52efdca0**: Fixed target URL: `${messagingUrl}/api/notifications${req.url}`

**Verification**: Endpoint now returns `200 OK` with empty notifications array
```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 0, "pages": 0 }
}
```

### 2. Model Registration Issues ✅
**Original Error**: `Schema hasn't been registered for model "User"`  
**Root Cause**: Mongoose models not using safe registration pattern, causing duplicate registration errors

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Commit 2f3c0e8b**: Updated all shared models to use `mongoose.models.ModelName || mongoose.model(...)`
  - User, Application, Conversation, Message, Notification, RefreshToken, SavedJob
- **Commit 4125383a**: Removed `.populate()` in getDashboardWorkers, using manual data joining instead

**Result**: Model registration error eliminated (now seeing MongoDB connection errors instead)

---

## 🔄 PARTIALLY FIXED / IN PROGRESS

### 3. Dashboard Workers Endpoint (500 Error)
**Current Error**: `Operation users.find() buffering timed out after 10000ms`  
**Status**: Model registration issue FIXED, but now encountering MongoDB connection timeout

**Technical Details**:
- User service cannot connect to MongoDB or connection is too slow
- Affects all user service endpoints that query MongoDB
- Timeout set to 10 seconds in Mongoose operations

**Action Required** (Project Owner):
1. Verify `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set correctly in Render for user service
2. Check MongoDB Atlas network access whitelist includes Render's IP ranges
3. Verify MongoDB cluster is running and accessible
4. Consider increasing connection timeout if network latency is high

**Environment Variables to Check**:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
# OR
USER_MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
# OR  
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
```

## ❌ UNRESOLVED ISSUES

### 4. Worker Endpoints Returning 404
**Affected Endpoints**:
1. `GET /api/users/workers/{userId}/availability` → 404
2. `GET /api/users/workers/jobs/recent?limit=6` → 404
3. `GET /api/users/workers/{userId}/completeness` → 404

**Investigation Status**:
- Routes exist in user-service/routes/user.routes.js (lines 41, 48, 49)
- Gateway proxy for `/api/users` is configured correctly
- 404 error message shows path as `/workers/...` not `/api/users/workers/...`
- Suggests path rewriting or route mounting issue

**Possible Causes**:
1. Gateway proxy pathRewrite not working correctly
2. User service route mounting issue
3. ServiceTrust middleware blocking requests
4. Route ordering causing incorrect matching

**Next Steps**:
- Add debug logging to Gateway proxy to see actual forwarded path
- Add debug logging to user service to see received request path
- Test routes directly on user service with proper headers
- Check if serviceTrust middleware is rejecting requests

### 5. Jobs Dashboard Endpoint (500 Error)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/jobs/dashboard`  
**Error**: Internal Server Error (likely similar MongoDB timeout)

**Status**: Not yet investigated in detail  
**Likely Cause**: Job service also has MongoDB connection issues

### 6. User Analytics Endpoint (500 Error)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/dashboard/analytics`  
**Error**: Internal Server Error (MongoDB timeout confirmed)

**Status**: Same root cause as dashboard/workers (MongoDB connection)  
**Fix**: Will be resolved when MongoDB connection is fixed

### 7. WebSocket Connection Failures
**Error**: `WebSocket is closed before the connection is established`  
**Frequency**: Multiple retry attempts visible in console logs

**Investigation Status**: Not yet investigated  
**Gateway Configuration**: WebSocket proxy exists (lines 612-671 in api-gateway/server.js)

**Possible Causes**:
1. WebSocket endpoint URL incorrect
2. Authentication issues with WebSocket connection
3. CORS configuration blocking WebSocket upgrade
4. Render free tier WebSocket limitations
5. Service spin-down causing connection failures

## 🔍 TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### Key Learnings:

1. **Missing Imports Break Everything**
   - Missing `axios` import caused authentication to fail globally
   - Always verify all dependencies are imported when adding new code

2. **Mongoose Model Registration Patterns**
   - Use `mongoose.models.ModelName || mongoose.model(...)` pattern
   - Prevents "Cannot overwrite model" and "Schema not registered" errors
   - Critical for shared models used across multiple services

3. **Populate vs Manual Joins**
   - `.populate()` can cause model registration issues in microservices
   - Manual data joining (separate queries + mapping) is more reliable
   - Slight performance trade-off but better error handling

4. **Express Path Handling**
   - `app.use('/path', handler)` strips `/path` from `req.url`
   - Manual proxies must reconstruct full target paths
   - Pattern: `${serviceUrl}/original/path${req.url}`

5. **MongoDB Connection Timeouts**
   - 10 second default timeout may be too short for cold starts
   - Render free tier services spin down, causing slow first requests
   - Need to verify connection strings and network access

### Architecture Patterns Confirmed:

✅ **API Gateway Pattern**
- Centralized routing working correctly
- Authentication middleware properly sets headers
- Service-to-service trust mechanism in place

✅ **Shared Models Architecture**
- Centralized models in `shared/models/` working
- Services correctly import shared models
- Safe registration pattern prevents conflicts

✅ **Microservices Separation**
- Each service independently deployable
- Clean service boundaries maintained
- No cross-service dependencies (good!)

## 📋 NEXT STEPS FOR PROJECT OWNER

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Check Render Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Render dashboard for kelmah-user-service-47ot:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
   ```

2. **Verify MongoDB Atlas Configuration**
   - Network Access: Add `0.0.0.0/0` or Render IP ranges
   - Database User: Verify credentials are correct
   - Cluster Status: Ensure cluster is running

3. **Test MongoDB Connection Locally**
   ```bash
   node -e "const mongoose = require('mongoose'); mongoose.connect('YOUR_MONGODB_URI').then(() => console.log('Connected!')).catch(err => console.error(err))"
   ```

### Development Session Actions:

1. **Add Debug Logging**
   - Gateway proxy: Log forwarded paths and headers
   - User service: Log received request paths
   - Identify where 404s are actually coming from

2. **Test Services Directly**
   - Bypass Gateway and test user service endpoints
   - Verify routes are mounted correctly
   - Confirm serviceTrust middleware is working

3. **Review Route Ordering**
   - Check if route ordering is causing conflicts
   - Ensure specific routes come before parameterized routes
   - Verify no duplicate route definitions
