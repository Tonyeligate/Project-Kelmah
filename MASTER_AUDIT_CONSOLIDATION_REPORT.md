## Critical Architecture Patterns Validated

### ✅ Microservices Architecture - EXCELLENT
```
API Gateway (Port 5000) → 6 Microservices (Ports 5001-5006)
├── Auth Service: JWT authentication, user management
├── User Service: Profile management, worker/hirer data
├── Job Service: Job posting, applications, search
├── Payment Service: Escrow, transactions, wallet
├── Messaging Service: Real-time chat, notifications
└── Review Service: Rating system, feedback
```

### ✅ Shared Resources Pattern - PERFECT
```
kelmah-backend/shared/
├── models/: User, Job, Application, Message, etc.
├── middlewares/: rateLimiter, serviceTrust
├── utils/: jwt, errorTypes, logger, monitoring
└── test-utils/: Basic testing utilities
```

### ✅ Domain-Driven Frontend - EXCEPTIONAL
```
src/modules/ (20+ domains)
├── auth/: Authentication, registration, MFA
├── jobs/: Job search, applications, management
├── dashboard/: Worker/hirer dashboards
├── messaging/: Real-time chat system
├── payment/: Escrow, wallet, transactions
└── [16 more domains]: Complete feature coverage
```

### ✅ Security Architecture - ROBUST
```
Authentication Flow:
Frontend → API Gateway → Service Trust → Microservice
    ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
JWT Token → Verification → User Context → Business Logic
```
