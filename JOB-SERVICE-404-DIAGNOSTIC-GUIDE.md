# üö® JOB SERVICE 404 DIAGNOSTIC & RESOLUTION GUIDE

## **PROBLEM SUMMARY**
- ‚ùå **Error**: `GET https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/api/jobs/contracts 404 (Not Found)`
- ‚úÖ **Code Status**: Endpoint EXISTS in codebase (`/api/jobs/contracts`) 
- üîç **Root Cause**: Render deployment configuration issue (wrong service deployed)

---

## **üîß IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS**

### **1. Verify What's Actually Deployed**
Test the deployed service identity:
```bash
curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Job Service API",
  "deployment": {
    "service": "kelmah-job-service", 
    "correctService": true,
    "status": "‚úÖ CORRECT DEPLOYMENT"
  },
  "endpoints": ["/api/jobs/contracts"]
}
```

**If WRONG SERVICE deployed, you'll see:**
```json
{
  "name": "User Service API",  // ‚ùå Wrong!
  "deployment": {
    "service": "kelmah-user-service",
    "correctService": false, 
    "status": "‚ùå WRONG DEPLOYMENT"
  }
}
```

### **2. Check Render Service Configuration**
In Render Dashboard for Job Service:
1. **Repository**: Must point to correct GitHub repo
2. **Branch**: Must be `main` (not `develop` or other)  
3. **Root Directory**: Must be `kelmah-backend/services/job-service`
4. **Build Command**: Must be `npm install`
5. **Start Command**: Must be `npm start` or `node server.js`

### **3. Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in Render:
```bash
SERVICE_NAME=kelmah-job-service
NODE_ENV=production  
PORT=10000 (or leave empty for default)
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è RESOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **OPTION A: Redeploy Correct Service (Recommended)**
1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Job Service
2. Click **Manual Deploy** ‚Üí **Clear cache and redeploy**
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test: `curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/api/jobs/contracts`

### **OPTION B: Fix Repository Configuration**
If wrong repo/branch is connected:
1. Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
2. Update **Repository** to correct GitHub repo
3. Update **Branch** to `main`
4. Update **Root Directory** to `kelmah-backend/services/job-service`
5. Trigger new deployment

### **OPTION C: Create New Service**
If configuration is severely corrupted:
1. Create new Web Service in Render
2. Connect to correct repository
3. Set correct root directory: `kelmah-backend/services/job-service`
4. Copy environment variables from old service
5. Delete old service after verification

## **üìä VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After fixing deployment:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Root endpoint returns Job Service info: `curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Health check responds: `curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Contracts endpoint works: `curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/api/jobs/contracts`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Frontend stops showing 404 errors in console
- [ ] ‚úÖ Contract fallback message disappears: "Using temporary contract fallback data"

---

## **üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Why This Happens**
1. **Render Deployment Issue**: Wrong service code deployed to Job Service URL
2. **Monorepo Confusion**: Multiple services in same repo, wrong directory selected
3. **Branch Mismatch**: Service pointing to branch without latest code
4. **Cache Issues**: Old build cached, not reflecting code changes

### **Code Verification**
The endpoint DOES exist in the code:
- **Route**: `kelmah-backend/services/job-service/routes/job.routes.js:48`
- **Controller**: `kelmah-backend/services/job-service/controllers/job.controller.js:332`
- **Mock Data**: Returns realistic contract data for testing

### **Frontend Impact**
- App gracefully handles the 404 with fallback data
- Service health monitoring detects the issue
- User experience maintained, but with limited functionality

---

## **‚ö° QUICK TEST COMMANDS**

```bash
# Test deployed service identity
curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/

# Test contracts endpoint  
curl https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/api/jobs/contracts

# Test from frontend (check browser console)
# Should see: ‚úÖ Response received instead of 404 errors
```

---

## **üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After fixing the deployment:
1. ‚úÖ **404 errors eliminated** from browser console
2. ‚úÖ **Contract data loads** from real API instead of fallback
3. ‚úÖ **Service health** reports all green
4. ‚úÖ **Frontend stability** fully restored

**This is a DEPLOYMENT issue, not a CODE issue. The fix is in Render configuration, not application code.**
