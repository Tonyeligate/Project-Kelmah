# Feature Specification: Real-Time Job Collaboration

**Feature Branch**: `001-real-time-collaboration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a real-time collaboration feature that allows hirers and workers to collaborate on job requirements in real-time, with live editing, comments, and version history. This should integrate with the existing messaging system and job management features."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Real-time collaboration on job requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Hirers, Workers
   ‚Üí Actions: Live editing, commenting, version history
   ‚Üí Data: Job requirements, comments, versions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Integration with messaging and job management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Job requirements, comments, versions, collaboration sessions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A hirer creates a job posting and invites a worker to collaborate on refining the job requirements. Both users can edit the job description, add comments, and see changes in real-time. The system maintains a complete version history of all changes.

### Core System Principles
The collaboration system must embody three fundamental principles:
1. **Find Errors and Fix**: Automatically detect conflicts, validation errors, and system issues, then resolve them intelligently
2. **Improve**: Continuously enhance user experience, performance, and functionality based on usage patterns
3. **Develop**: Build new capabilities and features that extend the platform's value

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a hirer has created a job posting, **When** they invite a worker to collaborate, **Then** the worker receives a notification and can access the collaboration interface
2. **Given** both users are viewing the job requirements, **When** one user edits the text, **Then** the other user sees the changes appear in real-time
3. **Given** users are collaborating on job requirements, **When** one user adds a comment, **Then** both users can see the comment and respond to it
4. **Given** users have made multiple changes, **When** they want to review the history, **Then** they can see a timeline of all changes with who made them and when
5. **Given** a collaboration session is active, **When** a user goes offline, **Then** their changes are saved and they can resume when they return
6. **Given** users are editing simultaneously, **When** conflicts occur, **Then** the system automatically detects and resolves conflicts intelligently
7. **Given** the system is running, **When** performance issues are detected, **Then** the system automatically optimizes and improves response times
8. **Given** users are collaborating, **When** new features are needed, **Then** the system can be extended without breaking existing functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when two users edit the same section simultaneously?
- How does the system handle network disconnections during editing?
- What happens to collaboration when a job is published or cancelled?
- How are conflicts resolved when users make contradictory changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow hirers to invite workers to collaborate on job requirements
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable real-time text editing with live updates visible to all participants
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a commenting system where users can add comments to specific sections of job requirements
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a complete version history of all changes with timestamps and user attribution
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with the existing messaging system to send collaboration invitations and notifications
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with job management features to save collaborative changes to job postings
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle concurrent editing by multiple users without data loss
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide conflict resolution when users make contradictory changes
- **FR-009**: System MUST save work automatically and allow users to resume editing after disconnection
- **FR-010**: System MUST show user presence indicators (who is currently editing)
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to revert to previous versions of job requirements
- **FR-012**: System MUST notify users when changes are made by other participants
- **FR-013**: System MUST support collaboration on both draft and published job postings
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain collaboration history even after job posting is published or cancelled

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Collaboration Session**: Represents an active collaboration between hirer and worker on a specific job posting
- **Job Requirement Version**: Represents a snapshot of job requirements at a specific point in time
- **Collaboration Comment**: Represents a comment made by a user on a specific section of job requirements
- **User Presence**: Represents the current status of a user in a collaboration session (online, editing, idle)
- **Change Event**: Represents a specific change made to job requirements with timestamp and user attribution
