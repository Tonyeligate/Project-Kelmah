# ðŸŽ¯ Spec-Kit Usage Examples for Kelmah Platform

## Complete Examples of Using Spec-Kit with Your Full Codebase

### **Example 1: Adding a Job Recommendation System**

This example shows how spec-kit generates specifications that affect multiple parts of your platform.

#### **Step 1: Generate Specifications**

**In VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat:**
```
I want to use the spec-kit methodology to plan a job recommendation system. Here's the template I want to follow:

/specify Add a job recommendation system that suggests relevant jobs to workers based on their skills, location, and previous job history. The system should learn from user behavior and improve recommendations over time. This should integrate with the existing job and user services and follow our three core principles: find errors and fix, improve, and develop.
```

#### **Step 2: Spec-Kit Generates**

**Backend Specifications** (`kelmah-backend/docs/specs/002-job-recommendations/`):
- **New Service**: `recommendation-service` with ML algorithms
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/recommendations/jobs`, `/api/recommendations/learn`
- **Database Models**: User preferences, job features, recommendation history
- **Integration**: Connects to job-service and user-service

**Frontend Specifications** (`kelmah-frontend/docs/specs/002-job-recommendations/`):
- **New Module**: `recommendations` module
- **Components**: `JobRecommendationCard`, `RecommendationSettings`, `LearningProgress`
- **Pages**: `RecommendationsPage`, `RecommendationHistoryPage`
- **Services**: `recommendationService.js`, `recommendationSlice.js`

#### **Step 3: Implementation Tasks**

**Backend Tasks:**
- T001: Create recommendation-service structure
- T002: Implement ML recommendation algorithms
- T003: Add recommendation API endpoints
- T004: Integrate with job-service and user-service
- T005: Add recommendation learning system

**Frontend Tasks:**
- T006: Create recommendations module
- T007: Implement recommendation components
- T008: Add recommendation pages
- T009: Integrate with Redux store
- T010: Add recommendation settings

### **Example 2: Enhancing the Messaging System**

#### **Step 1: Generate Enhancement Specifications**

**In VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat:**
```
I want to use the spec-kit methodology to enhance the existing messaging system. Here's the template I want to follow:

/specify Enhance the existing messaging system with file sharing, video calls, and message reactions. The system should maintain all existing functionality while adding new features. This should integrate with the existing messaging service and follow our three core principles: find errors and fix, improve, and develop.
```

#### **Step 2: Spec-Kit Generates**

**Backend Enhancements** (`kelmah-backend/docs/specs/003-messaging-enhancements/`):
- **Enhanced Service**: Updates to existing `messaging-service`
- **New Endpoints**: `/api/messages/files`, `/api/messages/reactions`, `/api/messages/video`
- **Database Updates**: File storage, reaction tracking, video call logs
- **Integration**: Connects to existing messaging infrastructure

**Frontend Enhancements** (`kelmah-frontend/docs/specs/003-messaging-enhancements/`):
- **Enhanced Module**: Updates to existing `messaging` module
- **New Components**: `FileUpload`, `VideoCall`, `MessageReactions`
- **Enhanced Pages**: Updated `MessagingPage` with new features
- **Services**: Enhanced `messagingService.js` with new functionality

### **Example 3: Mobile App Integration**

#### **Step 1: Generate Mobile App Specifications**

**In VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat:**
```
I want to use the spec-kit methodology to plan a mobile app for the Kelmah platform. Here's the template I want to follow:

/specify Create a React Native mobile app that provides core Kelmah functionality including job browsing, messaging, and profile management. The app should work offline and sync when online. This should integrate with the existing backend services and follow our three core principles: find errors and fix, improve, and develop.
```

#### **Step 2: Spec-Kit Generates**

**Mobile App Specifications** (`kelmah-mobile/docs/specs/001-mobile-app/`):
- **New Project**: `kelmah-mobile` React Native app
- **Core Features**: Job browsing, messaging, profile management
- **Offline Support**: Local storage and sync mechanisms
- **Integration**: Connects to existing backend services

**Backend Updates** (`kelmah-backend/docs/specs/001-mobile-app/`):
- **API Enhancements**: Mobile-optimized endpoints
- **Offline Support**: Sync mechanisms and conflict resolution
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications for mobile
- **Authentication**: Mobile-specific auth flows

## ðŸ”§ **Practical Implementation Workflow**

### **Step 1: Plan the Feature**

1. **Navigate to spec-kit**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\aship\Desktop\Project-Kelmah\spec-kit
   ```

2. **Open VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code C:\Users\aship\Desktop\Project-Kelmah
   ```

3. **Start GitHub Copilot Chat**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "Copilot" â†’ "GitHub Copilot: Start Chat"

4. **Use spec-kit templates**:
   ```
   I want to use the spec-kit methodology to plan [your feature]. Here's the template I want to follow:

   /specify [Your feature description] that [what it does] and [how it helps users]. This should integrate with the existing [relevant services] and follow our three core principles: find errors and fix, improve, and develop.
