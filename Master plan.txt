---

## ‚úÖ EXECUTION PROGRESS UPDATE (Current Sprint)

The following items have been implemented in the codebase since this plan was authored. These updates unblock Ghana market payments, real-time messaging, worker portfolio, and hirer tools, and introduce in-app notifications.

### Implemented
- Ghana Payments (backend + frontend integration paths)
  - Added Mobile Money endpoints expected by frontend under `/api/payments/*`:
    - `POST /api/payments/mtn-momo/request-to-pay`, `GET /api/payments/mtn-momo/status/:referenceId`, `POST /api/payments/mtn-momo/validate`
    - `POST /api/payments/vodafone-cash/request-to-pay`, `GET /api/payments/vodafone-cash/status/:referenceId`
    - `POST /api/payments/airteltigo/request-to-pay`, `GET /api/payments/airteltigo/status/:referenceId`
  - Implemented AirtelTigo Money integration (initial) alongside MTN and Vodafone integrations.
  - Frontend `paymentService` now routes Mobile Money calls to these endpoints.
  - Payment-service now emits in-app notifications (init/success/payout) via messaging-service.

- Real-time Messaging & Notifications
  - Socket.IO rooms (user_*, conversation_*), typing indicators, read receipts, presence, and message send acknowledgements are active.
  - File attachments:
    - New upload API: `POST /api/messages/:conversationId/attachments` in messaging-service; saves and returns URLs.
    - Frontend now uploads via API, reports progress, then emits `file_shared` with real URLs.
  - In-app notifications:
    - Messaging-service emits `notification` to `user_{id}` rooms for offline recipients of new messages.
    - Notification socket client added; NotificationContext subscribes and hydrates inbox in real-time.

- Worker Portal (Phase 3, Weeks 8‚Äì10)
  - Components created: `PortfolioGallery`, `ProjectShowcase`, `SkillsVerificationPanel`, `CertificateManager`, `WorkSampleUploader`, `AdvancedCalendar`, `EarningsReports`, `PerformanceMetrics`, `GoalTracker`, `ProposalBuilder`, `RateCalculator`, `SkillGapAnalysis`, `TrainingRecommendations`.
  - New page/route: `/worker/portfolio` wired and fetching from `/api/profile/portfolio/search`.
  - User-service uploads: `POST /api/profile/portfolio/upload`, `POST /api/profile/certificates/upload`.

- Hirer Portal (Phase 4, Week 11)
  - Components created: `JobCreationWizard`, `SkillsRequirementBuilder`, `BudgetEstimator`, `WorkerComparisonTable`, `BackgroundChecker`.
  - New page/route: `/hirer/tools` (hirer-only) bundling these tools.
  - Background verification stub: `POST /api/profile/background/verify` (user-service).

### Revised Status Snapshot
- Payments (Ghana coverage): from 40% ‚Üí 65% (endpoints wired; AirtelTigo integration present; full provider credentials + receipts pending)
- Real-time features: from 30% ‚Üí 60% (rooms/typing/attachments/notifications working; production hardening pending)
- Worker: from 60% ‚Üí 75% (portfolio UI + uploads wired; verification workflows pending)
- Hirer: from 65% ‚Üí 70% (tools added; persistence to job-service for wizard pending)

## üö® **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES DISCOVERED**

### **üî¥ EMERGENCY FIXES REQUIRED (FIX WITHIN 48 HOURS)**

#### **1. Database Architecture Chaos**
```
STATUS: CRITICAL BLOCKER
PROBLEM: Services mixing MongoDB and PostgreSQL causing failures
EVIDENCE:
- kelmah-backend/services/messaging-service/package.json has BOTH Mongoose AND Sequelize
- kelmah-backend/services/job-service/package.json has conflicting dependencies  
- Models scattered across services with different database patterns
- Migration scripts incomplete and inconsistent

IMPACT: Core functionality broken, services can't start properly
SOLUTION: Standardize on PostgreSQL, remove MongoDB dependencies
```

#### **2. API Gateway Routing Failures**
```
STATUS: CRITICAL BLOCKER  
PROBLEM: Frontend can't reach backend services reliably
EVIDENCE:
- kelmah-backend/api-gateway/server.js has incomplete routing
- Service discovery mechanism missing
- CORS configuration blocking legitimate requests
- Health checks failing across services

IMPACT: Users cannot authenticate, load data, or perform actions
SOLUTION: Complete API Gateway implementation with proper routing
```

#### **3. Authentication State Management Conflicts**
```
STATUS: HIGH PRIORITY
PROBLEM: Dual state management causing UI chaos
EVIDENCE:
- AuthContext and Redux both managing authentication state
- Login.jsx using both patterns inconsistently
- State synchronization issues across components
- Token refresh mechanism incomplete

IMPACT: Users getting logged out, authentication failures
SOLUTION: Standardize on single state management pattern
```

#### **4. Mobile Experience Catastrophic Failure**
```
STATUS: BUSINESS CRITICAL (Ghana is 95% mobile)
PROBLEM: Mobile UI completely inadequate for target market
EVIDENCE:
- Authentication pages not mobile-optimized
- Touch targets too small (< 44px)
- Forms difficult to use on mobile
- Loading states poor
- Navigation broken on mobile

IMPACT: Platform unusable for 95% of Ghana market
SOLUTION: Complete mobile redesign (ALREADY STARTED)
```

*Implementation Readiness: PRODUCTION-GRADE*  
*Market Focus: GHANA-OPTIMIZED* üá¨üá≠

**üöÄ READY FOR SUPREME EXECUTION! üöÄ**


Short answer: not done yet. I updated Master plan.txt with all completed work and a precise ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs left‚Äù plan. Major remaining items need provider credentials/infra decisions to continue.
What‚Äôs still required to finish
S3 signed-URL uploads (replace local /uploads)
Need: AWS_REGION, S3_BUCKET, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
I‚Äôll add presign endpoints and client upload once creds are provided.
Persist JobCreationWizard fully
Confirm createHirerJob targets /api/jobs via gateway to job-service. If not, I‚Äôll wire it and map wizard fields to job-service schema.
Notification preferences (UI is added)
I can add a route (e.g., /settings/notifications) in your frontend router to expose it.
Remove Redux-auth duplication + finalize refresh
I‚Äôll refactor routes/pages to use useAuth only and ensure axios refresh is the single path.
Push/email/SMS providers
Need: Firebase/OneSignal keys, SendGrid/Mailgun API key, preferred Ghana SMS provider credentials.
DB standardization (messaging-service to Postgres/Sequelize), core models across services.
PWA offline/GPS/camera and perf/monitoring (Redis, indexes, Sentry/APM) and compliance.
Ready to proceed
Share AWS + provider credentials and I‚Äôll implement S3 signed-URL flow and provider integrations next.
If you want me to keep going without creds, I‚Äôll wire presign stubs that activate automatically when env vars are present.
