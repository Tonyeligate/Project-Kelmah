I found the issue. Render.com isn't using your .env file - it's using the environment variables configured in the Render dashboard.\n\nThe solution is to update the environment variables in the Render dashboard. Go to:\n\n1. https://dashboard.render.com\n2. Select your auth-service\n3. Click on 'Environment' in the left sidebar\n4. Make sure all these variables are set correctly:\n   - SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com\n   - SMTP_PORT=465\n   - SMTP_USER=anthonyjioeeli@gmail.com\n   - SMTP_PASS=gagqcptenhykvzbm\n   - EMAIL_FROM=anthonyjioeeli@gmail.com\n\n5. Click 'Save Changes'\n6. Deploy again\n\nYour local .env file is correct, but Render ignores it and uses its dashboard settings.
