## üìñ How to Use These Diagrams

1. **Start with System Overview** to understand the big picture
2. **Frontend Architecture** for UI development understanding
3. **Data Flow Sequence** to understand user interactions
4. **Microservices Architecture** for backend development
5. **Database Models** for data structure understanding
6. **Deployment Architecture** for DevOps and deployment

Each diagram includes:
- Visual Mermaid diagrams for clear understanding
- Detailed explanations of components and relationships
- Technology choices and architectural decisions
- Best practices and design patterns used

## üîÑ Keeping Diagrams Updated

These diagrams should be updated when:
- New services or modules are added
- Database schema changes occur
- Deployment infrastructure is modified
- Major architectural decisions are made

## üìù Diagram Format

All diagrams are created using **Mermaid** syntax for:
- Version control compatibility
- Easy editing and maintenance
- Consistent visual formatting
- Integration with documentation platforms
