## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah.git
   cd Project-Kelmah
   ```

2. **Start Backend Services**
   ```bash
   # Start all microservices (API Gateway + 6 services)
   node start-api-gateway.js
   node start-auth-service.js
   node start-user-service.js
   node start-job-service.js
   node start-messaging-service.js
   node start-user-service.js
   node start-review-service.js
   ```

3. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd kelmah-frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - API Gateway: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Services: `http://localhost:5001-5006`

### Production Deployment

The platform uses automated deployment with LocalTunnel for external access:

```bash
# Start tunnel and auto-update configurations
node start-localtunnel-fixed.js

# Deploy frontend to Vercel (automatic on tunnel URL change)
# Backend services run on containerized infrastructure
```

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Service Architecture Patterns

**Backend Services** follow consistent patterns:
```
services/[service-name]/
├── server.js         # Express app with middleware
├── routes/           # Route definitions
├── controllers/      # Request handlers
├── models/           # Service model index (imports shared)
├── services/         # Business logic
└── middlewares/      # Service-specific middleware
```

**Frontend Modules** follow domain-driven design:
```
src/modules/[domain]/
├── components/       # React components
├── pages/           # Route components
├── services/        # API integration
├── contexts/        # React contexts
└── hooks/           # Custom hooks
```

### Key Development Commands

```bash
# Health checks
curl http://localhost:5000/health/aggregate  # All services health

# Testing
npm run test:integration                    # Full integration test suite
npm run monitor                            # Real-time performance monitoring

# User setup
node create-gifty-user.js                    # Test user creation

# Deployment
node start-localtunnel-fixed.js              # Tunnel management
```

## 📡 API Architecture

### Gateway-Centric Design
All client requests route through the API Gateway:
```
Client → /api/* → API Gateway → Service Proxy → Microservice
```

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/jobs` - Job listings with filtering
- `POST /api/jobs/{id}/apply` - Job applications
- `GET /api/messages` - Real-time messaging
- `POST /api/payments/escrow` - Secure payments

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket Proxying**: Real-time messaging through gateway
- **Event-Driven**: Message queue integration
- **Live Updates**: Instant notifications and status changes

---

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### MongoDB Collections
- **Users**: Authentication and profile data
- **Jobs**: Job postings with requirements
- **Applications**: Job applications and status
- **Messages**: Real-time communication
- **Payments**: Transaction and escrow data
- **Reviews**: Rating and feedback system

### Shared Models Pattern
All services use centralized Mongoose schemas from `kelmah-backend/shared/models/` for consistency and maintainability.
