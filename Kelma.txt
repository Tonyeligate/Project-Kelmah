# Kelmah Project Documentation

## Project Overview
Kelmah is a comprehensive platform designed to connect vocational job seekers with potential hirers. The platform facilitates efficient job matching, worker discovery, and seamless communication between parties. Built with a modern tech stack and a responsive design, Kelmah aims to revolutionize how vocational job hiring works.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React**: The frontend is built using React for component-based UI development
- **Material-UI**: Provides a comprehensive component library with a consistent design language
- **Redux**: Manages application state, particularly for authentication and notifications
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing
- **Axios**: Makes HTTP requests to the backend API

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js & Express**: Powers the RESTful API
- **Prostgrel**: Stores user profiles, job listings, reviews, and messages
- **JWT**: Handles user authentication
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time messaging and notifications

### 6. Messaging System

## Overview
The Kelmah messaging system provides a real-time communication platform for workers and hirers to connect, discuss job details, and build professional relationships. The messaging interface is intuitive, responsive, and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the platform.

## Architecture
The messaging system follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based UI components with Material-UI styling for consistent design
- **State Management**: Context API for local state management and real-time updates
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls for conversation and message management
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication for secure messaging

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **MessageContext**: Context provider that manages conversation and message state
   - Handles active conversations, messages, loading states, and error handling
   - Provides methods for sending, deleting, and managing messages

2. **AuthContext**: Authentication context that integrates with the messaging system
   - Manages user state and authentication tokens
   - Controls access to protected message routes

3. **MessageService**: Service layer for API communication
   - Handles all API calls related to messaging
   - Provides methods for managing conversations and messages
   - Includes mock data generation for development

4. **ConversationList**: UI component for displaying and selecting conversations
   - Shows conversation previews with last message, timestamp, and unread indicators
   - Provides search functionality to filter conversations
   - Handles conversation selection

5. **MessageList**: UI component for displaying messages in a conversation
   - Renders message bubbles with sender information and timestamps
   - Groups messages by date for better readability
   - Supports different message types (text, image, attachment)
   - Includes message actions (copy, delete)

6. **MessageInput**: UI component for composing and sending messages
   - Text input for typing messages
   - File attachment support with preview
   - Emoji picker integration
   - Progress indicators for sending status

7. **MessagesPage**: Main page component that integrates all messaging components
   - Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly navigation between conversations and messages
   - Error handling and empty state displays

### API Endpoints
The messaging system communicates with the backend through the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/messages/conversations`: Retrieves all conversations for the current user
- `POST /api/messages/conversations`: Creates a new conversation with another user
- `GET /api/messages/conversations/:id`: Retrieves messages for a specific conversation
- `POST /api/messages/conversations/:id/messages`: Sends a new message in a conversation
- `PUT /api/messages/conversations/:id/read`: Marks all messages in a conversation as read
- `DELETE /api/messages/messages/:id`: Deletes a specific message
- `POST /api/messages/attachments`: Uploads file attachments for messages
- `GET /api/messages/stats`: Retrieves message statistics for the current user

3. System creates a new conversation if one doesn't exist
4. User is redirected to the MessagesPage with the conversation open
5. User can type and send messages

### Responding to a Job Inquiry
1. Hirer receives a message notification
2. Hirer navigates to MessagesPage
3. Conversation with unread messages is highlighted
4. Hirer opens the conversation and views messages
5. Hirer responds with text and/or attachments
6. Worker receives the response in real-time

## Data Models

### Conversation Model
```javascript
{
  id: String,                 // Unique identifier
  participants: [String],     // Array of user IDs
  lastMessage: {              // Most recent message
    id: String,
    senderId: String,
    content: String,
    createdAt: Date,
    type: String
  },
  unreadCount: Number,        // Number of unread messages
  updatedAt: Date,            // Last activity timestamp
  createdAt: Date             // Creation timestamp
}
```

### Message Model
```javascript
{
  id: String,                 // Unique identifier
  conversationId: String,     // Reference to conversation
  senderId: String,           // User who sent the message
  content: String,            // Message text content
  type: String,               // 'text', 'image', 'attachment', 'system'
  attachment: {               // Optional attachment
    url: String,
    type: String,
    filename: String,
    size: Number
  },
  isRead: Boolean,            // Read status
  createdAt: Date,            // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date             // Last update timestamp
}
```
