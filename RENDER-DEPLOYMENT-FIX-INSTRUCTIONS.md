# üö® **RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

## **üîç TEST RESULTS CONFIRM THE PROBLEM:**

```
Job Service Health Check Response: "Service: User Service"
Expected Response: "Service: Job Service"
Contracts Endpoint: 404 Not Found
```

**üí° ROOT CAUSE:** The Render deployment for `kelmah-job-service.onrender.com` is pointing to the **User Service codebase** instead of the Job Service!

Also ensure JWT secrets are set (no fallbacks allowed):
```
JWT_SECRET=<64+ random>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<64+ random, different>
```
And confirm API Gateway has WS proxy enabled for messaging.

## **üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ON RENDER:**

### **STEP 1: LOG INTO RENDER DASHBOARD**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to your services

### **STEP 2: LOCATE THE PROBLEMATIC SERVICE**
1. Find the service with URL: `kelmah-job-service.onrender.com`
2. Click on the service to open its settings

### **STEP 3: CHECK REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION**
**CRITICAL:** Verify these settings are CORRECT:

```
Repository: Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah
Branch: main
Root Directory: kelmah-backend/services/job-service
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
```

**‚ùå WRONG Configuration (Current Issue):**
```
Root Directory: kelmah-backend/services/user-service  ‚Üê WRONG!
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT Configuration (What it should be):**
```
Root Directory: kelmah-backend/services/job-service   ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

### **STEP 4: UPDATE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**
Ensure these environment variables are set:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
SERVICE_NAME=job-service
DATABASE_URL=[Your MongoDB connection string]
```

### **STEP 5: FORCE REDEPLOY**
1. Save the corrected settings
2. Click "Manual Deploy" 
3. Select "Deploy Latest Commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (3-5 minutes)

## **üîç VERIFICATION STEPS:**

### **After fixing, test these URLs:**

1. **Service Identity Check:**
   ```
   GET https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/health
   Expected Response: "service": "job-service" ‚úÖ
   ```

2. **Contracts Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/api/jobs/contracts  
   Expected Response: 200 OK with contracts data ‚úÖ
   ```

3. **Deployment Verification:**
   ```
   GET https://kelmah-job-service.onrender.com/
   Expected Response: "deployment": { "status": "‚úÖ CORRECT DEPLOYMENT" }
   ```

## **üìä CURRENT STATUS:**

### **‚úÖ WORKING SERVICES:**
- ‚úÖ **Messaging Service:** MongoDB connection fixed, responding properly
- ‚úÖ **User Service:** Working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Auth Service:** Working correctly

### **‚ùå BROKEN SERVICES:**
- ‚ùå **Job Service:** Pointing to wrong codebase on Render
- ‚ùå **Contracts Endpoint:** 404 errors due to wrong service

---

## **üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:**

### **BEFORE (Current):**
```
‚ùå kelmah-job-service.onrender.com ‚Üí User Service codebase
‚ùå /api/jobs/contracts ‚Üí 404 Not Found
‚ùå Health check ‚Üí "service": "user-service"
```

### **AFTER (Fixed):**
```
‚úÖ kelmah-job-service.onrender.com ‚Üí Job Service codebase  
‚úÖ /api/jobs/contracts ‚Üí 200 OK with contract data
‚úÖ Health check ‚Üí "service": "job-service"
```

---

## **‚ö° FRONTEND IMPACT:**

Once fixed, the frontend will:
- ‚úÖ **Stop using fallback contract data**
- ‚úÖ **Load real contracts from Job Service**
- ‚úÖ **No more 404 errors on dashboard**
- ‚úÖ **Proper contract management functionality**

---

## **üö® THIS IS THE FINAL CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:**

**All code fixes are complete and deployed. The only remaining issue is the Render deployment configuration pointing the Job Service URL to the wrong codebase.**

**Once this is fixed, ALL data fetch errors will be resolved!** üéâ

---

**Next Step:** Fix the Render deployment configuration as outlined above, then run the test script again to verify success!
