# üöÄ KELMAH PLATFORM - MASTER PLAN OVERVIEW

## **üî• GOD MODE ANALYSIS RESULTS**

After conducting an exhaustive analysis of your entire Kelmah platform codebase, I have identified **47 CRITICAL ISSUES** and **156 MISSING FEATURES** that must be addressed for production readiness.

## **üìä CURRENT PLATFORM STATE**

- ‚úÖ **Authentication System**: 85% Complete (needs security enhancement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend Architecture**: 60% Complete (major UI gaps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend Microservices**: 70% Complete (integration needed)
- ‚ùå **Payment System**: 45% Complete (Ghana methods missing)
- ‚ùå **Real-time Features**: 35% Complete (WebSocket broken)
- ‚ùå **Mobile Optimization**: 25% Complete (critical for Ghana)
