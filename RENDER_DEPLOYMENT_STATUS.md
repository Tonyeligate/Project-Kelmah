# RENDER DEPLOYMENT MONITORING GUIDE

## What Just Happened

‚úÖ **FIXED:** Double slash issue causing 404 on job browsing  
‚úÖ **PUSHED:** Commit `1f4750eb` to GitHub  
‚è≥ **DEPLOYING:** Render is auto-deploying the API Gateway now

---

## Monitor Deployment Progress

### 1. Check Render Dashboard
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

**Look for:**
- **kelmah-api-gateway** service
- Should show "Deploying" status
- Wait for "Live" status (takes 2-5 minutes)

### 2. Watch Deployment Logs
Click on **kelmah-api-gateway** ‚Üí **Logs**

**Look for:**
```
==> Build successful üéâ
==> Deploying...
==> Your service is live üéâ
```

### 3. Verify Fix is Deployed
After deployment completes, check the commit hash in logs:

**Should show:**
```
Checking out commit 1f4750eb in branch main
```

---

## Test the Fix

### Once Deployment is Complete (5-10 minutes)

Open the frontend and try browsing jobs:
- Go to: https://kelmah-frontend-cyan.vercel.app
- Click "Browse Jobs" or refresh homepage
- **Expected:** Jobs should load (no more 404)

### If Still Getting 404:
1. Wait another 2-3 minutes (cold start)
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check if API Gateway finished deploying

---

## Remaining Issue: Worker Search

The worker search still returns **500 Internal Server Error** due to:
- **User Service** missing `MONGODB_URI` environment variable

### How to Fix (After Job Fix is Verified):

1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí **kelmah-user-service**
2. Click **Environment** tab
3. Add variable:
   - **Key:** `MONGODB_URI`
   - **Value:** `mongodb+srv://TonyGate:0553366244Aj@kelmah-messaging.xyqcurn.mongodb.net/kelmah_platform?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Kelmah-messaging`
4. Click **Save Changes**
5. Service will auto-redeploy
