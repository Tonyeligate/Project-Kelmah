# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX: Render API Gateway Configuration Issue

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED FROM SCREENSHOT

Your Render dashboard shows:
- **Service**: `kelmah-api-gateway`
- **Repository**: `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah` ‚úÖ (correct)
- **Branch**: `main` ‚úÖ (correct)
- **Deployed Commit**: `05eceec` ‚ùå (WRONG - spec-kit commit)
- **Should be**: `17e9aeda` (main repo with API Gateway fix)

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIREDsee

### Step 1: Click "Settings" in the Left Sidebar
You should see a Settings section in the left menu of the kelmah-api-gateway page.

### Step 2: Go to "Build & Deploy" Section
Look for these settings:

**Root Directory**: This is CRITICAL. It must be set to:
```
kelmah-backend/api-gateway
```

**Build Command**: Should be:
```
npm install
```
OR
```
npm ci --only=production
```

**Start Command**: Should be:
```
node server.js
```

### Step 3: Verify "Repository" Section
Still in Settings, check the Repository section:

**Repository**: Should be `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah` (no `/spec-kit`)
**Branch**: Should be `main`

### Step 4: Force Manual Deploy with Correct Commit

Since Render is stuck on the wrong commit (`05eceec`), you need to **force it to use the correct commit**:

1. **Click "Manual Deploy" button** (top right of the page - I can see it in your screenshot)
2. **Select Branch**: `main`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Look for a way to specify the commit or "Clear Cache"
4. **Deploy**

If there's no way to specify commit in Manual Deploy:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Build & Deploy**
- Look for **"Clear build cache"** option
- Clear the cache
- Then trigger Manual Deploy again

### Alternative: Add Build Command Flag

If the above doesn't work, try modifying the Build Command temporarily:

**Settings** ‚Üí **Build & Deploy** ‚Üí **Build Command**:
```bash
npm cache clean --force && npm install
```

This forces npm to ignore cache and might help Render recognize the correct commit.

---

## üîç WHY THIS IS HAPPENING

Render is confused because:
1. Your repository has a `spec-kit` submodule
2. The submodule points to the same repository URL
3. Render's git checkout is landing on the submodule's commit (`05eceec`) instead of the main repo's latest commit (`17e9aeda`)
4. The spec-kit doesn't have the proper directory structure, so `/opt/render/project/src/package.json` doesn't exist

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT THE CORRECT SETTINGS SHOULD BE

### In Render Dashboard ‚Üí kelmah-api-gateway ‚Üí Settings:

**Repository Section**:
```
Repository: Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah
Branch: main
Auto-Deploy: Yes
```

**Build & Deploy Section**:
```
Root Directory: kelmah-backend/api-gateway
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: node server.js
Node Version: 22.x (or leave as default)
```

**Environment Variables** (if not set):
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=Deladem_Tony
INTERNAL_API_KEY=kelmah-internal-key-2024
```

---

## üöÄ EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX

After correct configuration and redeployment, build logs should show:

```
‚úÖ Cloning from https://github.com/Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah
‚úÖ Checking out commit 17e9aeda in branch main (NOT 05eceec)
‚úÖ Using Node.js version 22.16.0
‚úÖ Running build command 'npm install'...
‚úÖ Installing from /opt/render/project/src/kelmah-backend/api-gateway/package.json
‚úÖ npm install succeeded
‚úÖ Build succeeded
‚úÖ Service deployed
```

---

## üÜò IF ROOT DIRECTORY IS ALREADY CORRECT

If the Root Directory is already set to `kelmah-backend/api-gateway` and it's still failing:

### Option 1: Disconnect and Reconnect Repository
1. Settings ‚Üí Repository
2. Click "Disconnect" (if available)
3. Reconnect to `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah`
4. Ensure branch is `main`
5. Manual Deploy

### Option 2: Create New Service
As a last resort:
1. Create a **New Web Service**
2. Connect to `Tonyeligate/Project-Kelmah`
3. Branch: `main`
4. Root Directory: `kelmah-backend/api-gateway`
5. Build Command: `npm install`
6. Start Command: `node server.js`
7. Copy environment variables from old service
8. Deploy new service
9. Delete old service after verification

---

## üì∏ NEXT SCREENSHOT NEEDED

After you go to Settings, please share a screenshot of:
1. **Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy** section (showing Root Directory)
2. **Settings ‚Üí Repository** section (showing repo URL and branch)

This will help me confirm if the configuration is correct or needs changes.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME ESTIMATE

- Check Settings: **2 minutes**
- Fix Root Directory (if needed): **1 minute**
- Clear cache and Manual Deploy: **3 minutes**
- Build and deployment: **2-3 minutes**
- **Total: ~10 minutes**

---

## üéØ CRITICAL POINT

**The issue is NOT in your code or GitHub repository. Everything there is correct.**

**The issue is in Render's configuration** - it's deploying from the wrong commit (spec-kit instead of main repo).

Once we fix the Render configuration, the deployment will work immediately! üöÄ
