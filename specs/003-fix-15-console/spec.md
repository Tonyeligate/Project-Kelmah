# Feature Specification: Console Error Resolution & System Resilience

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-15-console`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix 15 console errors across FE/BE with 5-step investigation, safe defaults, graceful degradation, and mobile compatibility"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Kelmah platform user (worker or hirer), I need the application to work reliably without crashes, failed network requests, or broken functionality, so that I can successfully find work, hire talent, communicate, and complete transactions without technical barriers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm browsing the Find Talent page, **When** the bookmarks API fails or returns empty data, **Then** the page renders without crashing and shows appropriate fallback content
2. **Given** I'm not logged in, **When** I try to view job details, **Then** the system prompts me to sign in instead of making unauthorized API calls
3. **Given** I have a valid token, **When** I access job details, **Then** the job information loads successfully with a 200 response
4. **Given** I'm using the messaging system, **When** I try to start conversations, **Then** the REST API returns success responses and Socket.IO connects properly
5. **Given** I'm accessing user credentials or bookmarks, **When** the system makes these requests, **Then** the endpoints return expected data shapes without 404 errors
6. **Given** my session expires, **When** the system attempts token refresh, **Then** it makes one attempt and gracefully signs me out on failure without endless retry loops

### Edge Cases
- What happens when backend services are temporarily unavailable (503 errors)?
- How does the system handle WebSocket connection failures on mobile networks?
- What occurs when CORS blocks requests from the production domain?
- How does the UI respond when API responses contain null or undefined data?
- What happens when external browser extensions inject conflicting JavaScript?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Network Resilience & Error Handling
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement safe defaults for all API responses, preventing null/undefined data from causing UI crashes
- **FR-002**: System MUST limit token refresh attempts to prevent infinite retry loops and gracefully sign out users on persistent failures
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement proper array guards for all list rendering operations to prevent "map of undefined" errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fallback UI states when backend services return 503 Service Unavailable errors

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent unauthorized API calls by checking authentication state before making protected requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST prompt users to sign in when accessing protected content without valid tokens
- **FR-007**: System MUST properly attach authorization headers to all authenticated requests

#### API Endpoint Availability
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide working endpoints for user credentials retrieval at `/api/users/me/credentials`
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide working endpoints for bookmark management at `/api/users/bookmarks` and `/api/users/workers/:id/bookmark`
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all frontend API calls are properly routed through the API Gateway
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide working conversation endpoints at `/api/conversations` for messaging functionality

#### Real-time Communication
- **FR-012**: System MUST establish reliable WebSocket connections for real-time messaging
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle WebSocket connection failures gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure Socket.IO endpoint routing works correctly from production domains

#### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- **FR-015**: System MUST configure CORS headers to allow requests from production and development domains
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle preflight OPTIONS requests correctly for all API endpoints

#### Mobile Compatibility
- **FR-017**: System MUST ensure all error handling and fallback mechanisms work correctly on mobile devices
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain responsive design and functionality during network error states

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Error Response**: Standardized API error format with consistent shape across all services
- **Health Check Status**: Service availability information used to determine retry strategies
- **User Session**: Authentication state including token validity and refresh capabilities
- **Network Request**: HTTP calls with proper authorization, error handling, and retry logic
