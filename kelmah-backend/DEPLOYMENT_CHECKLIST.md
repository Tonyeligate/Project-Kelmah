### Bid Self-Service Route Verification
Run these smoke checks after any API gateway or job-service deployment that changes bid routing.

```bash

GET /api/bids/me?limit=5
GET /api/bids/stats/me

# Expected behavior
- /api/bids/me returns 200 with paginated bid data under data.items or equivalent normalized data
- /api/bids/stats/me returns 200 with worker bid quota and usage statistics
- Neither endpoint should fall through to /:bidId handlers or return CastError for value "me"
```
