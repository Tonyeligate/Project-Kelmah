RECOMMENDED RESTRUCTURING [Taking LC Portal Inspiration]
1. HERO/WELCOME SECTION REDESIGN
Current: Duplicate "Welcome back" messages
Recommended:

Single, prominent welcome banner with quick stats (Active Jobs: 0, Active Workers: 0, Total Spent: $0)

Move this to hero section at top of Overview tab

2. PRIMARY ACTION GRID (NEW LAYOUT CONCEPT)
Below the welcome section, introduce a Service Card Grid similar to LC Portal:

text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Post Your First Job    │  Find Talent    │  Browse Applications  │
│  (Purple card)          │  (Blue card)    │  (Yellow card)        │
│  Icon at top            │  Icon at top    │  Icon at top          │
│  "Post a job to find..." │  Description   │  Description          │
│  [Button: Post Now]     │  [Button: Find] │  [Button: Browse]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Benefits:

Immediate call-to-action visibility (LC Portal strength)

Task-based rather than data-based entry points

More inviting for new users

Follows LC Portal's proven pattern

3. DASHBOARD TABS REORGANIZATION
Current Tab Structure:
Overview | Jobs | Proposals | Payments | Progress | Reviews | Find Talent

Recommended Structure (LC Portal inspired):

Overview (Dashboard home with key metrics)

My Jobs (Job Management - combines Jobs + Applications)

Messages/Communication (Replace Proposals with this)

Payments (Keep as is)

Progress (Keep as is)

Find Talent (Move to secondary/sidebar)

4. LEFT SIDEBAR IMPROVEMENTS
Keep: User profile section, rating, profile completion tracker
Modify:

Add icons to all navigation items

Use consistent color scheme with Kelmah yellow (#FFD60A)

Move secondary actions (Notifications, Messages, Disputes, Settings, Premium) to a collapsible "More" section

Reduce visual clutter

5. TOP NAVIGATION BAR OPTIMIZATION
Current Issues: Navigation scattered (top nav + sidebar + tabs)
Recommended:

Simplify top nav to: Home | Post a Job | Find Workers | Pricing | Messages (with badge)

Move "Find Workers" to be more prominent

Keep Notifications bell and Profile menu in top right (current placement is good)

Theme toggle and notifications should stay visible

6. METRIC CARDS LAYOUT
Current: 4 colorful cards displayed on Jobs tab
Recommended for Overview Tab (LC Portal style):

Display as 2 rows of 3 cards instead of current inline layout

More balanced grid structure

Consider softer color palette for less eye-strain:

Total Jobs Posted: Calm purple (#6C5CE7)

Total Amount Spent: Muted green (#00B894)

Applications: Soft blue (#0984E3)

Success Rate: Subtle orange (#FDCB6E)

Active Workers: Teal (#6C5CE7)

Pending Applications: Rose (#EE5A6F)

7. QUICK ACTIONS BUTTON
Current: Floating action menu with Post, Find Talent, Messages, Payments
Recommended:

Keep but place in top-right corner or integrate into header

Use consistent branding with Kelmah yellow

Alternatively: Move these to the primary action grid on Overview

8. EMPTY STATE IMPROVEMENTS
Current: "Ready to make your first hire?" with minimal guidance
Recommended (LC Portal inspired):

Use a larger, more prominent empty state card

Include step-by-step onboarding:

Post Your First Job

Review Applications

Hire and Pay Safely

Complete the Job

Add helpful tips and best practices

Include "View Examples" link to successful job postings

9. COLOR CODING & CONSISTENCY
LC Portal Pattern: Uses distinct background colors for different sections
For Kelmah:

Primary Actions (Hero Grid): Kelmah Yellow (#FFD60A) for primary buttons

Metric Cards: 4-5 distinct colors (maintain current approach but refine)

Success/Status indicators: Green

Pending/Warning: Orange

Errors: Red

Neutral: Gray
