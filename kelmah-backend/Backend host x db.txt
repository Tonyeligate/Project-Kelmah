Still on this fool.
(Okay now listen to me carefully. You are wasting my time so I want you to know how I want things to go from now unwards.
Mind you this project is not supposed to sit here on my local host forever so I want to move it and set it up or deploy it online. I am told Render is best for my backend but let me know if there is a better option. 
Also the frontend as you know is already on vercel so we will need to be fixing things there till all is right.
Can you help me get a plan on what to do and the services to use especially for the dbs too since I will want to (switch to a connection URL (e.g., AUTH_SQL_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname) and mangodb) and other services. So dive deep to my codebase and let me know what service to use(Make sure the services are free upfront and I can upgrade to pro when I become productive.)  and what to do next. )

(Bounded-Context Ownership
Postgres → all business-critical, transactional domains:
Users, profiles, roles
Jobs and applications
Contracts and milestones
Payments, escrow, wallets, invoices
Reviews & ratings aggregates
Notification preferences & configuration
Mongo → all real-time or flexible‐schema domains:
Messaging (conversations & messages)
In-app notification events feed
Activity logs (search history, rich analytics)
Cross-Reference by ID, not by Foreign-Key Joins
Every document in Mongo (e.g. a message) carries the Postgres user_id, conversation_id or job_id as a simple field.
Services that need to join data do so at the application layer (via async event-handlers or lightweight lookup queries), never by pointing Postgres to Mongo tables or vice versa.
Microservice Per Database
Keep each microservice owning its own datastore—no two services write to the same database.
Auth-service for example owns the Mongo “users” collection (for sessions, device tokens) and writes user metadata into Postgres.
Messaging-service owns its Mongo cluster exclusively; Job-service owns its Postgres schema exclusively.
Data Synchronization & Denormalization
Where real-time read performance matters on relational data (e.g., showing last message snippet on job listings), you can use an event listener (Kafka/RabbitMQ) to write a small denormalized row into Postgres or a Redis cache.
Likewise, if you ever need analytics of “jobs per user per day” you can stream Postgres transaction events into Mongo or a time-series store.
Why This Fits Kelmah’s Purpose
Reliability & ACID for money, contracts, user-profiles → Postgres
Scalability & schema-flexibility for chat/notifications → Mongo
Clear separation keeps each domain simple, testable, and horizontally scalable
Avoids cross-database foreign keys (which don’t exist between Postgres and Mongo) and prevents complexity in migrations/replication)


Backend Hosting
Primary: Render.com (free Web Services tier, Docker support)
Up to 750 hrs/mo ; auto-builds from your GitHub repo
Alternatives (if you want comparisons): Railway.app (free $5 credits/mo, easy DB addons), Fly.io (free 3 machines, built-in Postgres), or DigitalOcean App Platform (free “Starter” apps).
Why Render? It natively supports Docker microservices, private managed Postgres, and you already know it.
Databases
A) Postgres (ACID, relational domains)
On Render: “Databases” → New Postgres (Free, 1 instance, 256 MB)
Create “kelmah-auth” DB → copy URL → AUTH_SQL_URL
Create “kelmah-user” DB → copy URL → USER_SQL_URL
Create “kelmah-jobs” DB → copy URL → JOB_SQL_URL
Alternatives:
ElephantSQL “Tiny Turtle” (20 MB free), Supabase (1 GB free), Neon (5 GB free).
All give you a PostgreSQL URL you can drop into *_SQL_URL.
B) MongoDB (flexible, real-time domains)
MongoDB Atlas Free Tier (M0 cluster, 512 MB)
Spin up a free cluster → whitelist 0.0.0.0/0 or Render IPs → create a “kelmah-messaging” database → copy Atlas URI → MESSAGING_MONGO_URI
(You could also create a second free cluster for any other Mongo-backed service, though you might reuse the same cluster with separate databases/collections.)
Alternatives:
Render “Private Services” (Mongo) – but Atlas is more fully featured.
Appwrite or Firebase RTDB (if you ever want real-time alternatives).
Git & CI/CD
GitHub → push your main branch (you’ve already done this).
On Render → Connect your GitHub repo → one service per microservice (auth, user, jobs, messaging, payment).
For each service, set build command = npm install && npm run build (if needed) or rely on your Dockerfile.
Set port and Dockerfile path (services/XXX/Dockerfile).
Under “Environment,” add the appropriate *_SQL_URL or *_MONGO_URI variables.
Local Testing Before Deploy
Start each service locally:
cd kelmah-backend/services/auth-service && npm run dev
.../user-service && npm run dev
.../job-service && npm run dev
.../messaging-service && npm run dev
.../payment-service && npm run dev
Hit http://localhost:<port>/health for each → should return 200/OK.
Frontend Deployment & Env
You’re on Vercel already → update your project’s “Environment Variables” in Vercel dashboard:
VITE_API_URL → https://<your-auth-service>-on-render.com (or a load-balanced domain).
Any other VITE_* (messaging URL, etc.).
Redeploy Vercel → verify all pages build and fetch from your new backend endpoints.
Monitoring & Scaling
Render gives you logs & basic metrics → watch for errors on first deploy.
As you grow, you can upgrade Render Postgres to a larger tier, or move to Neon/Supabase Postgres.
Atlas can be upgraded to M2+, or you can add more clusters.
Next Steps
Provision all five backend services on Render, wiring up *_SQL_URL/*_MONGO_URI.
Deploy and verify each /health endpoint on Render’s URLs.
Update Vercel frontend env → redeploy.
Smoke-test the full flow:
Sign up → job posting → search → messaging → payment.
Add CI checks (GitHub Actions) to run lints/tests before each push.
This setup uses free tiers end-to-end, cleanly separates Postgres vs. Mongo by service, and gives you a straight path to “level up” each piece as Kelmah scales. Let me know which step you’d like to tackle first!
