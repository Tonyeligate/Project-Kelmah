# 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Database Migration

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

Your User Service is currently **BROKEN** with this error:
```
column "isPhoneVerified" does not exist
```

**This is preventing ALL user management functionality.**

## 🎯 **EXACT STEPS TO FIX (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Get Your Database Connection String (2 minutes)**

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click on your TimescaleDB Database**
3. **Go to the "Connection" tab**
4. **Copy the "External Database URL"**

It looks like this:
```
postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database_name
```

### **Step 2: Run Database Migration (2 minutes)**

In your current terminal (you're already in the scripts directory):

```bash
# Set your database URL (replace with the one you copied)
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://your_username:your_password@your_host:port/your_database"

# Run the migration
npm run migrate
```

### **Step 3: Restart Render Services (1 minute)**

1. Go back to your **Render Dashboard**
2. **Restart these services** (click the restart button for each):
   - kelmah-auth-service
   - kelmah-user-service  
   - kelmah-job-service
   - kelmah-payment-service
   - kelmah-messaging-service

## ✅ **How to Verify It Worked**

After the migration, test the User Service:

```bash
curl -s "https://kelmah-user-service.onrender.com/api/users"
```

**BEFORE (BROKEN):**
```json
{"success":false,"status":"error","message":"column \"isPhoneVerified\" does not exist"}
```

**AFTER (FIXED):**
```json
{"success":true,"data":[],"message":"Users retrieved successfully"}
```

## 🎉 **Expected Migration Output**

When you run `npm run migrate`, you should see:
