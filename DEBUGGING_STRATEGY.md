# THE MOST LIKELY ISSUE

Looking at the code flow, I suspect the problem is actually THIS:

## The Rate Limiting Middleware (Line 151-157 in server.js)

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const p = req.path || '';
  if (p.startsWith('/health') || p.startsWith('/api/health')) return next();
  if (p.startsWith('/api/jobs/my-jobs')) return next();
  if (p === '/my-jobs' || p.startsWith('/my-jobs')) return next();
  return defaultLimiter(req, res, next);
});
```

**The Problem:**
This rate limiter applies to ALL paths EXCEPT the ones listed.
The path `/?status=open` is NOT excluded, so it goes through the rate limiter.

**IF the rate limiter is failing** (Redis connection issue, etc.), it might be blocking the request!

## Another Possibility: The 'notFound' Handler

Line 215: `app.use(notFound);`

If the route doesn't match for ANY reason, this catches it and returns 404.

## What the debug logging will tell us:

**IF we see** `[JOB ROUTES] GET / matched!` in logs:
- Route IS matching
- Problem is in the controller or database query
- Need to check jobController.getJobs function

**IF we DON'T see** `[JOB ROUTES] GET / matched!`:
- Route is NOT matching
- Problem is either:
  1. Path isn't what we think it is
  2. Middleware is blocking before route
  3. Route mounting path issue

## Next debugging steps after deployment:

1. Check if `[JOB ROUTES] GET / matched!` appears in job-service logs
2. If YES → Check controller and database
3. If NO → Check middleware chain and path transformation
