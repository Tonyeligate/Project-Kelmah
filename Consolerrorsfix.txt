Complete Error List from Console Logs - UPDATED October 7, 2025
Based on latest console output after fixing runtime-config URL:

ðŸ”´ Category 1: CORS Errors (Critical - Blocking All Requests)
Multiple endpoints blocked by CORS policy:

GET /api/notifications â†’ CORS blocked
Error: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
Impact: Notifications completely blocked
Also returns 502 Bad Gateway and 404 alternating

GET /api/users/workers/{userId}/availability â†’ CORS blocked  
Error: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
Impact: Availability status not displayed
Returns 502 Bad Gateway after CORS

GET /api/users/workers/{userId}/completeness â†’ CORS blocked
Error: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
Impact: Profile completion percentage not showing

ðŸ”´ Category 2: 404 Errors (Routes Not Found After CORS)
GET /api/notifications â†’ 404 (when CORS doesn't block)
Error: "Messaging service endpoint not found"
Alternates with 502 and CORS errors

GET /api/users/workers/jobs/recent?limit=6 â†’ 404
Error: Request failed with status code 404
Impact: Recent jobs widget empty

ðŸ”´ Category 3: 500 Errors (Internal Server Error)
GET /api/users/dashboard/workers â†’ 500
Error: Internal Server Error
Impact: Dashboard worker stats failing
Note: Automatic retry attempted (1/5 retries shown)

ðŸ”´ Category 4: 502 Bad Gateway (Service Unavailable)
GET /api/notifications â†’ 502 Bad Gateway
Alternates with 404 and CORS errors
Indicates messaging service is down or unreachable

GET /api/users/workers/{userId}/availability â†’ 502 Bad Gateway
After CORS preflight

ðŸ”´ Category 5: 429 Rate Limit Errors (Too Many Requests)
GET /api/notifications â†’ 429 Too Many Requests
Impact: Multiple retry attempts hitting rate limit
Causing exponential backoff (3s â†’ 6s delays)
Repeated: 5+ times with increasing delays

ðŸ”´ Category 6: WebSocket Connection Failures
WebSocket connection failed
Error: "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established"
URL: wss://kelmah-api-gateway-5loa.onrender.com
Impact: Real-time notifications won't work
Repeated: 51+ connection attempts

ðŸ”´ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. CORS is the primary blocker - API Gateway not sending CORS headers to Vercel origin
2. Backend services returning 502/404 even when CORS passes
3. Rate limiting triggering due to retry loops
4. WebSocket upgrades failing (separate from CORS)
